## Simple Summary

Following [AIP-331](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/331/) giving mandate to Centrifuge to create a Association to represent the Aave DAO off-chain, this AIP proposes the activation of the A-C Prime Foundation.

## Motivation

This AIP payload serves as a DAO resolution providing biding approval from the Aave DAO to bring about a real-world asset specialised single-purpose vehicle, and approve and ratify the legals documents.

## Specification

This AIP does not require any on-chain changes. It is a proposal to activate the A-C Prime Foundation.

To explicitly convey the Aave DAO approval via its governance, an event is created on-chain casting the following message:

```
   The Aave DAO approves and ratify the following documents :

    1) The articles of Association : https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmXvgvLb87tFr8JmJjx7pAThAU1gAsHFLqdMa12zt2f6R6
    2) The Memorandum Of association : https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmaB3Z4oN4Bcc4SEZ8WH2duKLpPqRYKqYC5TMqpQaddfrB
