## Simple Summary

Proposing the renewal of the Orbit program for recognized delegates, compensating them with GHO, associated with their governance activity during Q4 2024 ( From 2024-08-31 to 2024-12-14).

## Motivation

Orbit recognizes the added value of the Delegates in the decentralization & diversity of the Aave DAO. This compensation allows them to focus on Aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter, Q4 2024, from 2024-08-31 to 2024-12-14.

## Specification

- **Period Coverage:** Q4 2024 from August 31th 2024 to December 14th 2024
- **Eligible Platforms:**
  - EzR3al
  - Areta
  - StableLab
  - IgnasDefi
- **Budget:** 60,000 GHO
- **Relevant Links:**
  - [ACIâ€™s Orbit tracker](https://dapps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)

**Additional considerations:**

As a reminder, Service Providers will not be considered elegible to Orbit Program.

A new vote rate will apply, starting next Orbit Renewal, where a minimum of 20k voting power and 85% vote ratio on all Snapshots and AIP will be considered in order to be elegible to Orbit Program.
